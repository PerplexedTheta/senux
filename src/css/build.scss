  WELCOME TO SENUX! VER. 2111-04 -- HAVE A NICE DAY!

  USER ALERT: DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE CONTENT HELD WITHIN THE OPACUSERCSS
  SYSPREF. INSTEAD, PLEASE MAKE ALL CSS CHANGES WITHIN THE CUSTOMISATIONS.SCSS
  AND/OR VARIABLES.SCSS FILES HOUSED WITHIN THE SENUX GIT REPOSITORY. THEN,
  RUN THE BUILD SCRIPT(S) AND FETCH THE OUTPUT FROM THE DIST DIRECTORY.
  
  THIS RESTRICTION IS IN PLACE BECAUSE A SCRIPT IS USED TO GENERATE THE CSS.
  MODIFYING THE CSS OUTSIDE OF RUNNING THIS SCRIPT CAN CAUSE ISSUES, AND LOSS
  IN CUSTOMISATIONS FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
